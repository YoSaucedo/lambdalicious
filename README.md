# Lambdalicious - Elegant Functional Programming in PHP

## Design Goals

- Decorate, wrap, fork, copy/paste, borrow, steal, shamelessly from smarter people than myself.
- Allow you to write beautiful, elegant, and expressive code, with a high signal-to-noise rate.
- Polluting your global namespace? Think of it as cleaning up the global namespace!
- Higher order baby!

Code shamelessly stolen from
