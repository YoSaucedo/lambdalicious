![Lambda Man by Martin Grabmüller](docs/lambda-man.jpg "Lambda Man by Martin Grabmüller")

## Design Goals

- LISPlike Love for Lists!
- Higher order functions baby!
- Gloriously global! Polluting your global namespace? Think of it as cleaning up your global namespace!
- Allow you to write beautiful, elegant, and expressive code, with a high signal-to-noise rate!
- Decorate, wrap, fork, copy/paste, borrow, steal shamelessly from smarter people than myself!
