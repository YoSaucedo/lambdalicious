Elegant Functional Programming in PHP

![Lambda Man by Martin Grabmüller](docs/lambda-man.jpg "Lambda Man by Martin Grabmüller")

## Design Goals

- Decorate, wrap, fork, copy/paste, borrow, steal shamelessly from smarter people than myself.
- Allow you to write beautiful, elegant, and expressive code, with a high signal-to-noise rate.
- Gloriously global! Polluting your global namespace? Think of it as cleaning up your global namespace!
- Higher order functions baby!

## Usage

```php
<?php

§([1, 2, 3])                    // Wrap an array with the ampersand function §()
    ->map(operator('+', 2))     // Map the array to a callback
    ->filter(operator('>=', 4)) // Filter $x where $x >= 4
    ->§;                        // Unwrap an array with the ampersand property ->§
                                // Returns [4, 5]

§(['hello', 'world'])
    ->map('ucfirst')
    ->fold(operator('.'), '');  // Concatenate all values
                                // Fold returns a value so no § needed
                                // Returns 'HelloWorld'    

```

## FAQ

### But but but, objects and fluent interfaces, is it really functional?

Yep. Blows your mind.

### Why does it do X? Why doesn't it do Y?

Dunno, I just built whatever I needed to get it to work for my use case, or whatever was easy to steal.

### Should I use it? Is it ready for production? 

If you can't make that decision for yourself, don't use it.

### How can I contribute?

I like you already! Use it, fix broken stuff, implement missing features from the libs listed below, measure and optimize performance, have awesome ideas.
