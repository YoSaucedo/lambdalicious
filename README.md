## FAQ

#### What is this all about?

Read the [The Little Schemer](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0262560992/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0262560992&linkCode=as2&tag=verraesnet-20&linkId=LWAZ2Z4LXEVNZNAH).
Or learn LISP (or Clojure or some variant).

#### Can you backport it to older PHP versions?

Boring, next question please.

#### Should I use it? Is it ready for production?

If you can't make that decision for yourself, don't use it.

#### I want to contribute!

I like you already!
